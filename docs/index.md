<body><p> <h3>A father’s success starts with his son’s first failure</h3>
  
I was into my tenth month as a trainee in HCL technologies working in its first product group put up in Leela palace hotel. Here i had the oppurtunity to deliver a proof of concept(POC) and had it working and ready to demo it to our product manager next week. I left the day saving the work on my PC as next three days i was to attend “Hibernate” training in our M.G road office. At six in the evening while i came out of the training along with Divya telling her i will go home directly as its half distance compared to my usual office. Not heading much into her stance that manager would expect to see me i started driving only to stop at a bustand thirty mins into my drive. It was to receive a call from my manager asking to keep the POC ready to be demoed the next morning to our delivery head. I returned back only to notice POC failing to even launch. I panicked, slogged overnight, tried everything possible only to fail and fail again. At 3:43 am I dialed back on one of the several missed calls and told my dad what had happend. With limited understanding of what I was saying he said; <i>"If this does not work, it’s not end of the world"</i> and with a small pause for me to pull myself, he continued, <i>"If it is still not working, you have not tried everything"</i> and he disconnected the call.<br>

These words may have come from anyone at anytime and anywhere but the timing and situation was different; I interpreted every word (actually said in Kannada) to its core meaning, the order in which they were told, the care in the tone and invisible pat while conveying, <i>"you will crack this"</i> made a significant impact.<br>

The POC worked after i restarted my machine, we did not demo – that is another story to tell.

 <h3>Show respect to elders, particularly if they are fools</h3>
 <br>
My far relative, a respected head of a village passed away. My dad went for the last rituals and took charge of the proceedings to be done. On the ceremony day an father of the deceased pointed out how things were supposed to be done instead and started blaming my father. Little did my father respond or justified his act even with villagers defending his way. 
Three years later, In my cousin's marriage I reached late and was escorted to a elderly person to take his blessings. Not knowing who he was I did just that out of respect for his age only to learn the worse later that this was the same person who insulted my father few years back in his village. I was furious with my dad and upon confronting received a conventional “respect the elders” lecture. Couple of hours later after dinner, I met this elderly person where he said, <i>“I am not very fond of your father, but I want you to grow up just like him”.</i> At that moment I could see the guilt in his eyes heavy up while he returned with his eyes to the ground. 

<h3>Winning a situation is much larger than winning an argument</h3>
<br>
My father has been the go-to person for any major events amoung our relatives and hence they seek his presence during marriage proposals and other events; One such relative asked my father to accompany them to bride’s home to discuss on marriage proceedings. Note here that my cousin and his to-be bride belonged to different caste though both the families followed similar culture. Bride’s father being very particular about his reputation in his village had several conditions in marriage rituals, but the conflict one came for a particular event which bride’s father felt as a disrespect in performing to a lower cast groom. There was lot of debate between parties until my father asked one question <i>“Was the said ritual performed at bride’s elder sister’s marriage?”</i>. This made the bride’s father go tom on the hot roof, started screaming with arms here and there. Some sensible people understood, cooled him and as a result of mellow discussion eventually marriage happened. In marriage during lunch bride's father came to my dad ( as he had taken the responsibility of marriage since bride's father could not do the marriage in his town) and started screaming again saying the food is not as expected, my dad enquired although had no fault on his side said, <i>"we can arrage it as per expectation".</i><br> 
Cut to the next day's dinner at bride's place, my father noticed one of the dish they were service had gone bad, he silently called the groom's brother and told him not to serve that dish. Both me and bride's father were surprised to hear that especially considering what had happend the previous day. Later my dad told me the reason for his mellow nature towards them. I myself am unable to learn this, as I still have my blood shoot up whenever I recollect that person hasn't even appologised to my father.
