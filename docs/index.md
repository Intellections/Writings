<body><p> <h3>A father’s success starts with son’s first failure</h3>
  
While being a fresher, I was responsible for delivering a POC and it was working to perfection as I left to attend a 3 day “Hibernate” training. At the end of day one as I stepped out of training room received a phone call from my manager asking keep the POC ready to be demoed to a prospective client the next morning. I hurried back only to notice POC failing to even launch. I panicked, slogged overnight, tried everything possible only to fail and fail again. At 3:43 am I dialed back on one of the several missed calls and told my dad what had happed. With limited understanding of what I was saying he said; <br>
<i>"If this does not work, it’s not end of the world." <br>
"If it is still not working, you have not tried everything." <br> </i>

If one boasted confidence, the other motivated. These statements could have come from anyone, anytime but there was a difference; I interpreted every word (actually said in Kannada) to a core meaning, the order in which they were told, the care in the tone and slightest of hope while conveying that his son will crack this made a significant impact.<br>
The POC worked, we did not demo – that is another story to tell.

 <h3>Respect elders, especially if they are fools</h3>
 <br>
My uncle, a reputed head of a village passed away and my dad went for the last rituals and took care of things to be done. On the 11th day function an elderly person pointed out how things were supposed to be done during rituals, started blaming and shaming my father. Little did my father respond or justified even with villages defending his deed. It was later I came to know that this person was not very fond of my father for reasons of family matter. 
Three years later in my cousin’s marriage, I reached late and was escorted by my dad to this same elderly person to take blessings. Not knowing who he was I did just that out of respect for his age only learn the worse later. I was furious with my dad and upon confronting received a conventional “respect the elders” lecture. Twenty minutes later after dinner, the elderly person came to me and said <i>“I don’t like your father, but I want you to grow up just like him”.</i> At that moment I could see the guilt in his eyes heavy up and bow his head. 

<h3>Right question avoids wrong discussions</h3>
<br>
My father has been into events like this where he helps parents get matches for their kids; My friend who was in Paris with me asked my father to accompany his parents to bride’s home to discuss on marriage rituals. Note here that my friend and his to-be bride belonged to different caste though both the families followed similar culture. Bride’s father being very particular about his reputation in his village had several requests in marriage rituals, but the conflict came for a particular culture which bride’s father felt disrespect in doing it for lower cast groom but refrainsed to say out loud. There was lot of debate until my father asked one question <i>“Was the said ritual performed at bride’s elder sister’s marriage?”</i>. This was like a nail in the coffin for the bride’s father and he started screaming. Some sensible people understood and cooled him down and eventually marriage happened. This incident for me stands out for two aspects; one, is to not get carried away when the discussion is wrong, two, is to know what exact question to ask.  

<h3>You eat to live not live to eat</h3>
My dad is slightly overweight, has diabetes and blood sugar. Say whatever may be the reason, the fact that he is not a perfect example of healthy person is not completely untrue. All that said, need all the good teachers be the best student.
I was a skinny boy when I was growing up but ate to the fullest and my mom was not a person to hold anything off my hands. My father could have scolded, teased or even restricted with supplies to tell me to eat as per need. But he chose to say something else.
<i>“You eat to live not live to eat”</i>, this followed up with excerpts from his struggle chapters which clearly convinced me. To this day I may not follow to the dot but I believe every single word he told me and when I reach that point of inculcating this habit into me then I will preach you for now it’s just there to motivate.
