<body> <p>A father’s success begins at his son’s first failure.
As a fresher, I was responsible for delivering a POC which was working to perfection when I left it to attend a 3 day “Hibernate” training; As I stepped out of day 1 training, I got a call from my manager asking the POC to be demoed to a prospective client the next morning. I hurried back only to notice POC failing to even launch. I panicked, slogged overnight, tried everything possible only to fail and fail again. At 3:43 am I called back on one of the several missed calls and told my dad what had happed.
With limited understanding of what I was saying he said;
1.	If this does not work, it’s not end of the world.
2.	If it is still not working, you have not tried everything. 
If one pulled my confidence sock up, other motivated.
These statements could have come from anyone, anytime. But there was a difference; I interpreted every word (actually said in Kannada) to a deep meaning, the order in which they were told , the care in the tone and slightest of hope while conveying that his son will crack this made a significant impact.
The POC worked, we did not demo – that is another story to tell.

Respect elders, especially if they are fools.
My uncle, a reputed head of a village passed away and my dad went for the last rituals and took care of things to be done. On the 11th day function an elderly person pointed out how things were supposed to be done during rituals, started blaming and shaming my father. Little did my father respond or justified even while villages defended him. It was later I came to know that this person was not very fond of my father for reasons of family matter. 
Three years later in my cousin’s marriage where I reached late and was escorted by my dad to this same person to take blessings. Not knowing who he was I did just that out of respect for his age only learn who later. I was furious with my dad and upon confronting received a conventional “respect the elders” lecture. Twenty mins later after dinner, the elderly person came to me and said “I don’t like your father, but I want you to grow up just like him”. At that moment I could see the guilt in his eyes heavy up and bow his head. 

Right question avoids wrong discussions.
My father has been into events like this where he helps parents get matches for their kids; My friend who was in Paris with me asked my father to accompany his parents to bride’s home to discuss on marriage rituals. Note here that my friend and his to be bride had a difference in caste though both the families followed similar culture. Bride’s father being very particular about his reputation in his village had several requests, but the conflict came at the place of a particular culture which bride’s father said he cannot do it. There was lot of debate until my father asked one question “Was the said ritual performed at bride’s elder sister’s marriage?”. This was like a nail in the coffin for the bride’s father and he started screaming. Some sensible people understood and cooled him down and eventually marriage happened.
This incident for me stands at the epitome of intelligent questioning.  

You eat to live not live to eat.
My dad is slightly overweight, has diabetes and blood sugar. Say whatever may be the reason, the fact that he is not a perfect example of healthy person is not completely untrue. All that said, need all the good teachers be the best student.
I was a skinny boy when I was growing up but ate to the fullest and my mom was not a person to hold anything off my hands. My father could have scolded, teased or even restricted with supplies to tell me to eat as per need. But he chose to say something else.
“You eat to live not live to eat”, this followed up with excerpts from his struggle chapters which clearly convinced me. To this day I may not follow to the dot but I believe every single word he told me and when I reach that point of inculcating this habit into me then I will preach you for now it’s just there to motivate.
